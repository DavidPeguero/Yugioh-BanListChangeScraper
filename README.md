# Yugioh-BanListChangeScraper

Simple webscraping for that finds the changes on the Forbidden/Limited list for the Yugioh Trading Card Game.


UPDATE:

First release!

Current Functionality:

    By default gives latest Forbidden/Limited in a table.
    On double-click of table element displays card image.
    You can search and highlight card in the table through the search bar. You can filter by name, advance format status, type of card, and remarks on card.
    You can view older Konami Forbidden/List with links from said lists. These are kinda hard to find, but I was able to use Wayback Machine to find the links and from my limited testing it worked. It should work as long as Konami has had the format to their list (HTML structure-wise)

What next?! Not sure, but what I've done so far has been a fun project. Could probably add ability to create custom banlists and save banlists for quick access. If anyone every downloads this, let me know if there is anything you think would make this useful for you.

Check the Release section to try it out yourself!
